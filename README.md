## Usage

```sh
Usage: animego-dl [options] <anime name>

CLI tool to download your favorite anime series.

Arguments:
  anime name                The name of anime series to download  [string] [required]

Options:
  -V, --version             output the version number

**note**: if you installed the package globally, you can simply run:

```

```
node ./dist/bin -d ./my-anime-directory '<anime series name>'`
```

---

### Output

The anime, of your choosing, will be downloaded to the directory that you
specfied at the `-d` option's argument.  A directory of the anime will be
created and named like: `Neon Genesis Evangelion (Dub) (1995)/`.  Each episode will be
numbered & named like: `episode-00.mp4`, `episode-01.mp4` .. etc.

Example:
```
my-anime
â””â”€â”€ Neon\ Genesis\ Evangelion\ (Dub)\ (1995)
    â””â”€â”€ episode-01.mp4
    â””â”€â”€ episode-02.mp4
    â””â”€â”€ episode-03.mp4
    â””â”€â”€ episode-04.mp4
```

---

> :warning: Please make sure that your input anime series title is properly
> formatted (improvements to tool will be made in the near future).

### Dub

You can specify a dub selection by suffixing your anime name with 'dub'.

Example(s):
  * specify dub: `animego-dl -d ./my-anime-directory 'Berserk dub'`
    - no special characters, params, or dashes

### Sub

Sub versions can be downloaded by providing just the title of the desired anime.

Examples:
  * specify sub: `animego-dl -d ./my-anime-directory 'sono bisque doll wa koi wo suru'`
    - no special characters, params, or dashes

### Docker

First, make sure you installed the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/vinnya3/animego-dl).

Next, create your desired mount directory -- this will be your machine's local
directory, where the anime will be downloaded; for example: `mkdir ./anime`

You can now start create the mount point & run the container:
```
docker run --rm -v ${PWD}/anime:/anime -it animego-dl /bin/bash
```

After running the aforementioned command, you will be directed to an interactive
shell session.  From here, you can run the tool as instructed [here](#usage).

:warning: **important note**: make sure the download directory, specified by the
`-d` option is `/anime` -- this is the mount point specified inside of the
container.  The actual download directory, on your host machine, is what you
specified earlier (when running the container).

Example(s):
```
#app> animego-dl -d /anime 'monster'
```
